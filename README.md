This is a Node Red Flow for a Vitron based Energy Storage System. 

My setup is a Victron Multiplus 2 with a PV system and a battery. I changed to Tibber and charge the battery in low price hours, use the battery in high price hours and keep the battery idle in between.
The system is based on a Venus OS Large Image on a Raspberry Pi.
